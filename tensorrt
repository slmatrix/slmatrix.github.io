## tenorrt

im going to teach myself make a tenorrt container. lets go.
this shit is the biggest headache I've had with NVIDIA so far. 
you MUST make sure the cuda for your GPU EXACTLY matches compatibility with
tensorrt.

for me, i use cuda 10.0 (cuz i got a 2080 Ti) and its tensorrt version MUST be
5.1.5.0 


### install tensorrt

these are cmds to run on ubuntu. it works for me on ubuntu on 18.04.2.
please read my docker webpage and then my cuda webpage; using a container always
works.

```markdown
`nvidia-docker run -it -v /home/<user_name>/shared_folder:/root/ cuda_build`

`download tensorrt from nvidia`
`dpkg -i nv-tensorrt-repo`
`apt-key add /var/nv-tensorrt-repo`
`apt update`
`apt install libnvinfer5=5.1.2-1+cuda10.0`
`apt install libnvinfer-dev=5.1.2-1+cuda10.0`
`apt install python3-libnvinfer-dev`
`apt install tensorrt`
```
